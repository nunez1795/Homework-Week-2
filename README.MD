# Lets Put Week 2 All Together

## The Web
When we speak about the Web we must cover the internet. The internet is a backbone
of a millions of networks to be connected to each other. It has services that use it
to be able to reach millions of people. The Web is one if not the largest of these services.
So how does the Web work or better yet how do we interact with the Web. We have done many
times without thinking about. The first thing we do is open a **_[browser](####Web-Browser)_** and enter an
address (URL). For this to work we have **_[Domain Name](Domain Name System)_**. The sit must also be **_hosted_**
somewhere to allows us to access it. After we enter the address a message is sent using **_HTTP_**
to the server were this sit is stored. After all the background processes are finished in our
**_browser_** we see the site. Sometime it is amazing that all this works. There are so many things
that have to go right for this to happen every time to ask to see a sit.

#### Web Hosting
Web Hosting is a service that allows you to be able to have you website put on the Web.
This is possible because companies have servers were you are able to load your files that
are needed for you website. You are basically renting the space out on the servers allowing
other computer to be able to access your website through their servers.

#### Domain Name System
A domain name is just the name of your website. It is the identity of your website.
You have to have a domain name to be able to have a website.
The domain name must also be registered for this to work. Think of a website as a
house, your house has an address so others can find it. The same for you domain
name, it need to be registered so others can find your website.
When you register you domain name you will also have a suffixes (.com or .gov),
many of these domains have requirements. For example if you are registering a
government website or an educational one will make a difference.
You must make sure all your information for your website in accurate when you
are registering it. If you make a mistake on this information if will cause you
website to have errors and page-load failures. This will not allow people to view your website.

#### Web Browser
We all have used a browser. Some have used chrome or maybe Explore form Microsoft.
But have you stop to think how it works.
When you enter an address in the browser it send a request to the server were the
website is stored. After a couple of background communications happen a website
is returned in HTML form. The browser then translates this and displays the website
into a form that make sense to the user.
